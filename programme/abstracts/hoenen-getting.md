The Integrated Modelling & Analysis Suite (IMAS) is composed of many software components developed by the ITER Organization and partners within the project. An ongoing effort aims at releasing the software in IMAS under open-source licences. The intention is to be able to reach a much wider audience and build a larger user/developer base without the administrative burden of formally agreeing access that is necessary for restricted-access closed-source software. To support new users becoming familiar with the IMAS open-source eco-system, a new set of documentation and examples have been prepared: they describe several typical use-cases (what do you want to do today?) and then dive into the installation and usage of tools and software available in IMAS to support them.

In this tutorial we will go through this new getting started material and describe a few use-cases with which we will highlight the installation and usage of software like the IMAS-Data-Dictionary (data model), IMAS-Python (data access API), IMAS-ParaView (data visualization), IMAS-Validator (data checks), and SimDB (simulation database management). Additional software may be covered as it appears publicly on https://github.com/iterorganization. We would also like to use this tutorial as an opportunity to welcome feedback on other use-cases and to discuss about the various ways to engage and contribute to IMAS.
