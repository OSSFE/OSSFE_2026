PathView is a new open-source graphical user interface for the PathSim system simulation framework, designed to lower the entry barrier for system modelling and accelerate research workflows. It provides an interactive drag-and-drop environment where users can construct models visually, while retaining the ability to generate fully executable Python code. PathView already supports over 60 node types, multiple solvers, and custom blocks for nuclear fusion fuel cycle applications. The range of potential applications in fusion is very broad, including fuel cycle modelling, plasma control, signal processing, exhaust, and essentially any dynamic system. Ongoing development focuses on improving user experience by streamlining block parameterisation, introducing a sub-assembly editor for modular modelling, and refactoring the codebase for greater maintainability. These enhancements aim to create a more intuitive, flexible, and extensible platform for open-source system simulation, supporting both education and advanced research use cases.
