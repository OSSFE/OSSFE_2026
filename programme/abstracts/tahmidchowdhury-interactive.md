This tutorial will provide a hands-on demonstration of NukeLab's capabilities for fusion energy research, with a focus on interactive simulation and visualization. We will showcase a custom, in-browser 3D visualization tool built with Trame and integrated within the Theia-based NukeIDE. As a practical example, we will guide participants through the process of setting up and running a neutronics simulation of a Tokamak fusion reactor using the open-source Monte Carlo code, OpenMC, and the openmc-plasma-source library. The tutorial will cover the entire workflow from model creation and simulation to post-processing and visualization of the results, all within the NukeHub ecosystem.
