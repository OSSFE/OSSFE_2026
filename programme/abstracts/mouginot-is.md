Over the past 3 years I have been offering my services as a freelance scientist.
During this time, I have worked for universities, startup companies and even investment funds, doing a wide range of work such as bug fixing, best practices development mentoring, large Pull Request submissions, conducting studies, refactoring large pieces of software…
While I understand the need to internalize knowledge and experiences, and the potential spending constraints, there is a possible added value of freelancers in Open Source Scientific Simulation. I would be interested in walking you through my scientific freelance journey, in order to raise awareness about our relevancy.  
As I am breaching the topic of the rising need for independent contractors in our fields, I would like to discuss hypothetical interests and constraints related to hiring such experts as a private company (such as quick pathing startups) or academic research groups.
