We present the latest developments in TORAX, an open-source, differentiable tokamak core transport simulator designed for fast and accurate simulations. Its recent improvements, which include significant performance enhancements, API improvements, and new physics modules, have made it an even more powerful tool for pulse planning and optimization. These developments, along with a growing ecosystem of open-source surrogate models like QLKNN_7_11, establish TORAX as a state-of-the-art platform for predictive modeling in fusion research.
