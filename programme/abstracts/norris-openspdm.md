Simulation Process and Data Management solutions, now known as Digital Engineering for Modelling and Simulation, have been used by leading engineering and fusion  research organisations for many years to ensure FAIR (Find, Access, Interoperate, Reuse) data management, Digital Thread traceability, assure quality of simulation results, increase productivity and engineering throughput. Leading users of SPDM include BMW, Audi and Sandia Labs. 
The need for FAIR data management for fusion research was established at the DoE ASCR workshop  on the Management and Storage of Scientific Data in 2022 at which 92 position papers were presented.

openSPDM is based on industry best practice. It incorporates a connector framework which enables simulation applications to be  connected to the platform rapidly at least cost. Connectors to popular simulation applications for fusion have been developed as open-source. openSPDM incorporates parameters as data base items so that physicists and engineers can search for simulations based on input or result values. openSPDM supports multi-fidelity simulations 0D, 1D, 3D and system simulations as it is based on Aras Innovator which offers a Systems Architecture Model Based Systems Engineering module. 

This presentation describes the technology of Simulation Data Management and how it has been instantiated in  openSPDM to  support fusion research and reactor development.
