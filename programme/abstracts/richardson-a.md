In this introductory tutorial, I will present some basic finite-element fundamentals using the FEniCS software package. There will be an introduction, describing FEniCS, some of the features that are available, and a follow-along tutorial with interactive notebooks. Starting from a simple problem in 1D, we will build up to solving the Poisson equation in 2D, elasticity and heat-flow problems. Everything will be available as Google Colab notebooks, for your own tinkering and experimentation.
